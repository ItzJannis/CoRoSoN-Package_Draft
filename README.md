## CoRoSoN_Util
Providing usefull utility functions like macros to initialize data, verbose debugging or error handling

>### ERRORS and ERROR_CODE
ERRORS is a bitmap for ERROR_CODES for ease of use \
Available ERROR_CODES:
>#### OKAY
No error occured
>#### CONNECT_FAILED
Connection to device could not be established
>#### INVALID_ANSWER
Answer of device does not match protocol
>#### INVALID_PARAMETER
Parameters do not match requirements (i.e. speed > 100%)
>#### INVALID_CONFIG
Configuration does not match parameters request
>#### PROCESS_RUNNING
Internal process still running or internal timer not yet ready (i.e. kick right after kick => cooling time not over)
>#### ERROR_IGNORED
Error ignored, so no break out and no error handling happended \
Generally you should not ignore errors, but if they happen while doing the setup it might be useful to ignore the error to allow the setup function to finish i.e.
>#### ERROR_HANDLED
Error handled and function continued with handled error (i.e. speed > 100% ==> speed = 100%)
>#### ERROR_BREAK_OUT
Error could not be handled and lead to early exit of the function

### COROSON_DEBUG
If this is defined the verbose debugging functionsare compiled in.
>#### DEBUG_PRINT(Variable)
Prints the value passed in a verbose string to the serial monitor inlcuding origin of print and variable name
>#### DEBUG_BLOCK(Message, NumMillis)
Blocks the programm in an endless loop by epeatadly prints the passed massage every numMillis milliseconds

### Function macros
>#### MIN(X,Y)
Returns the smaller one of the two values
>#### MAX(X,Y)
Returns the bigger one of the two values
>#### ABS(X)
Returns the absolute value of the passed argument (works with all number types)
>#### ARRAY_LENGTH(Arr)
Returns the number of elements in the passed array (**Do not use with heap-allocated Arr**)
>#### ZEROMEM(Obj)
Sets all bytes of Obj to 0 (**Dont use with heap-allocated Obj**) 
>#### ZEROMEM_N(Obj, NumBytes)
Sets the first NumBytes bytes of Obj to 0

## CoRoSoN_Eeprom
Providing usefull utility functions to make use of the ESP32's eeprom \
i.e. save last robot state to restart into it after reset
>#### struct EEPROM_DATA
Modifiy this struct for the eeprom interactions to read / write data however you like. \
Every eeprom interaction will read or write 1 instance of this struct
>#### ERRORS EEPROM_Init(unsigned short Address)
Initializes the ESP32's eeprom at the passed address
>#### EEPROM_DATA EEPROM_Read()
Reads the currently in the eeprom stored EEPROM_DATA
>#### ERRORS EEPROM_Write(const EEPROM_DATA& Data)
Writes the passed EEPROM_DATA to the eeprom

## CoRoSoN_I2C
Providing a simpler, more beginner friendly interface to work with the I2C bus system used in CoRoSoN kit
>#### ERRORS I2C_Init(unsigned short SerialDataPin, unsigned short SerialClockPin)
Initialises the I2C bus on the board with the given data and clock pin
>#### ERRORS I2C_TestConnection(unsigned short Address)
Tests if connection to the given address is possible
>#### ERRORS I2C_Write(unsigned short Address, byte aMessageBytes[], unsigned int NumBytes)
Writes the passed Data byte per byte to the given address
>#### ERRORS I2C_ReadBlocking(unsigned short Address, byte aAnswerBytes[], unsigned int NumBytes)
Reads the passed number of bytes from the passed address and stores the answer in the passed byte array \
**Attention**: \
This functions waits for the answers and is therefore **blocking** \
Make sure that NumBytes equals the length of the passed byte array

\> 0 => goal to the right
>##### int DirectionOwnGoal(void)
